Non-PRIVMSG commands to Zohlai
------------------------------

Zohlai supports several commands other than PRIVMSG.

Listed are the command, the required Zohlai privilege (the ircd may require
specific ircop privileges as well) and the effect. Unfortunately, some ircds do
not support all of these commands, and there is not always a /msg equivalent.

<zohlai> means Zohlai's server name or a name of a service.

/admin <zohlai> (-) Show administrative information (adminname and adminemail
from zohlai.conf).

/info <zohlai> (-) Shows copyright information and a list of authors.

/motd <zohlai> (-) Shows etc/zohlai.motd (some substitutions are done).

/stats <letter> <zohlai> (-) Shows various statistics and configuration
information. The following letters are recognized:
	B (general:auspex) Shows hash statistics.
	C (general:auspex) Shows uplink blocks.
	E (general:auspex) Shows events.
	F (general:auspex) Shows open connections.
	K (operserv:akill) Shows akills.
	O (general:viewprivs) Shows operator blocks.
	T (general:auspex) Shows various counts.
	u (-) Shows services uptime.
	V (general:auspex) Shows current uplink name and connect duration.
	X (operserv:massakill) Shows sglines.
	Y (general:auspex) Shows some uplink connection parameters.

/squit <jupe> (-) Removes a jupe.

/trace <zohlai> (-) Shows a listing of all services (with server name) or
a single service. If listing all services, general:auspex also causes a line
describing the uplink to be sent. Two-argument trace as in TSora ircds is
also supported.

/version <zohlai> (-) Shows version information, slightly more detailed than
a CTCP reply.

/whois <zohlai> <client> (-) Shows WHOIS information about <client>:
nick, username, vhost, server, server description, ircop status, services
login name. Note that this works for all clients on the network, not just
services and no channel information is shown. It is assumed that networks
that want to hide which server users are on do not allow remote whois other
than /whois <nick> <nick>.
